# Motor Trend MPG Analysis

This project uses the `mtcars` dataset to investigate whether manual or automatic transmission results in better fuel efficiency (measured in MPG).

## 🔍 Project Summary

We performed both simple and multiple linear regression models:

- **Simple Regression**: Manual cars appeared to have 7.25 more MPG on average.
- **Adjusted Regression**: After accounting for weight and horsepower, the advantage drops to 2.08 MPG and is **not statistically significant**.
- **Conclusion**: Transmission type alone does not explain fuel efficiency.

## 📁 Files Included

- `motor_trend_analysis.Rmd` – Full R Markdown analysis
- `motor_trend_analysis.pdf` – Rendered report

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- R
- R Markdown
- ggplot2 for visualisation
- `lm()` for regression modelling

## 📈 Key Learnings

- Importance of controlling for confounding variables
- Interpretation of coefficients, p-values, and confidence intervals
- Use of diagnostic plots to assess model assumptions
